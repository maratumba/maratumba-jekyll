Day 1, they still haven't figured out I'm not a static site generator person yet.

Not a clue as how to include images yet. Too lazy to check markdown syntax.

We'll see what happens if I don't include the footer thingies like [jekyll-docs] info at the bottom. Weird that you'd have to paste it at the bottom of all posts. Also, wtf `vim`? Can't you highlight markdown properly?
